              <h3>When should I consider doing a slab leak test?</h3>
              <p>
                There are a few instances where a slab leak test is beneficial to you and others:
                <ul>
                 	<li><strong data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">Purchasing or selling a home or business</strong>: If you are <a href="https://www.augerpros.com/plumbing-checklist-for-new-home-buyers/">purchasing or selling </a>your home or business, it's a very good idea to get your water and sewer lines tested for slab leaks. If you are buying the property, it will give you peace of mind going into the purchase that you don't have that large issue to contend with. If you are selling your home, the results of a slab leak-free building can offer confidence to the buyer that the property is not being damaged by a slab leak.</li>
                 	<li><strong>Noticing obvious signs of a slab leak</strong>: Noticing doors not shutting any more, cracks in the walls, in the tile floors, hot spots on the floor, water coming out of the foundation, sewer smell constantly are signs that you should have the tests done.</li>
                 	<li><strong>Foundation repair being done</strong>: Whenever you are having foundation work done, generally it's a requirement to have a <a href="https://www.augerpros.com/what-is-a-hydrostatic-plumbing-test/">slab leak test </a>done on the water and sewer lines, but even if it's not, you should still have the peace of mind of having them done. Moving a foundation, even a little can wreak havoc on your plumbing under the slab.</li>
                </ul>
